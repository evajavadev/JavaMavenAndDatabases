## The Lean Account

<br>

The four repo's below are a continuation from a school assignment, where the orginally account resides under the develop branch in our school repository.

In this stage I found it useful and really educating to separate the project components now in use, from the ones that will be added later on. So the Lean Account includes only the following components:

### IntelliJ and content 

Just clone or download the Lean Accounts below. Using IntelliJ will make it easy since the project is developed with IntelliJ. 

<b>Lean Account/Develop 10 July</b> &nbsp; this account is the starting point for the four accounts. Play around with all the tests (common, integration and unit). Every test works fine but note the test message that will be given for the `AccountComponentEntityUnitTest` in its component `account-component-test-unit`. And follow its path to the comment in file    

<b>Lean Account/Develop 17 July</b> &nbsp; in this account the error is solved. And `placeOrder` is added. 

<b>Lean Account/Develop July Merged</b> &nbsp; this account is just a merge between the two accounts above. For an easy history comparence. 

<b>Lean Account/Develop Further Services</b> &nbsp; and here, the merged account with additional new services.
